## My process

### Built with

- HTML
- CSS

### What I learned

I learned different ways to create gradients and how to apply hover effects to a button with a gradient background. I realized that using `:hover` alone isn't enough to change the gradient, it's necessary to redefine the entire background or use other techniques like transitions or overlays to achieve the desired effect.
### Continued development

To keep improving, Iâ€™d like to:

- Add basic animations for score reveal  
- Convert the layout into a reusable component using a framework like React
